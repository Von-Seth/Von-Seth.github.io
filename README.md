## FAQ
- __Q:__ Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
  - __A:__ 
- __Q:__ Why is my resume not showing up?
  - __A:__ It could be that your GitHub-Page is still being built. Open your repository and click the *Actions* tab. Under the workflow runs if you see any *orange circle* or text saying *queued* then your GitHub-Page is still being built.
  - __Solution:__ Leave it running for 5 minutes and comeback.
