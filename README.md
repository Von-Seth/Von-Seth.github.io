# FAQ ‚ùì
- __Q:__ Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
  - __A:__ Most static site generators use Markdown files as inputs, because of this it makes it easy to update a static sites content without needed to rewrite any HTML or CSS, saving you much time.
- __Q:__ Why is my resume not showing up?
  - __A:__ It could be that your GitHub-Page is still being built. Open your repository and click the *Actions* tab. Under the *workflow runs* if you see any *orange circle* or text saying *queued* then your GitHub-Page is still being built.
  - __Solution:__ Leave it running for 5-10 minutes and comeback.
