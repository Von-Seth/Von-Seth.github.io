Congrats on clicking the about page! 

This GitHub-Pages environment is mainly for a school assignment that is currently in the works, we'll see how long this stays up after the course.

*pfff* This is the About page and I haven't introduced myself. I'm Robert, however Von Seth is the alias connected to most things I create on this wonderful thing we call the internet. I enjoy learning new things, and things that I forgot after a week.
